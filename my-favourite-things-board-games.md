# Board Games


## Playing Online

### [RocketCrab](https://rocketcrab.com/)

Open source platform (on [GitHub!](https://github.com/tannerkrewson/rocketcrab)) to play mostly part games such as Avalon, Secret Hitler, A Fake Artist Goes to New York. Some of these games require additional tools, e.g. A Fake Artist Goes to New York only doles out roles and doesn't handle the actual drawing. Bring your own pens!

### [BoardGameArena](https://boardgamearena.com/lobby)

A lightweight web app with a thriwing community. I am a reviewer on the site and the pipeline of new games is amazing.

### [Tabletopia](https://tabletopia.com/)

Tabletopia offers more newer games compared to BoardGameArena and their implementation is more of a 3D simulation of the game. It's more resource intense too, but worth trying!

### Smaller sites

* [Codenames](https://codenames.game/) - multi-language support.
* [Decrypto](https://whoawhoa.github.io/decrypto/)
