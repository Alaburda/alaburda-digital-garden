# Citizen Research

This is an oddball of a category but it includes any research material that might be conducted by people outside academia. Prime examples include high schoolers - in Lithuania, high schoolers can elect to conduct a research project for a better rank when enrolling. Another group would be teachers - they might not want to conduct research but they might want to present the means of research out there. Finally, there are the curious and bored :)

## Tools

1. [PsychoPy](https://psychopy.org/) - open source behavioural research platform based on Python. Haven't used but seems robust and has academic backing.
1. [osmdata](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/osmdata/vignettes/osmdata.html) - an R package to interface with OpenStreetMap data. I have previously used shapefiles hosted elsewhere so this is better.
