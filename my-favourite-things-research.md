## Posters

The general consensus for posters is a paper with all the figures and less text. However, that is definitely not the best approach as each conference attendee will care about your poster for exactly 3 seconds. That's why it's best to do the following:

* Make the title BIG. Don't be afraid to add color, make the title approachable by people outside your field.
* Don't structure the poster the way you would structure a paper. Put your introduction, the key figures and your findings at the *top*. The bottom of the poster is something people never look at. 
* Add a QR code! It may not have been useful five years ago and that probably has not changed, but it does make sure that someone might keep a tab open with your poster.
