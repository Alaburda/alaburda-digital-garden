# (PART) My Favourite Things {-} 

This section is split by category to contain lists or ideas for various things in life, e.g. books.

# Books

This is not a comprehensive guide but more of a compendium of links and sources for future self-reference. I suspect some of these might become deprecated or some of the recommended lists will not hold up to time. Nonetheless, I think it might be interesting to capture this snapshot and compare to my scope next year.

I think society overrates book recommendations - we have yearly book lists, best-of clickbait articles and influencers trying to push whatever would seem acceptable or commendable by society. As in, if everyone's talking about it, it must mean it's good? However, we live in a time where we have access to the world's Library of Alexandria in the form of LibGen and we are seeing more literature in translation (for example, this year [a Latvian book has finally been translated into Chinese](http://www.latvianliterature.lv/en/news/top-ten-latvian-literature-moments-of-2019)!). With that, this list is more of an atlas where to potentially find good books. I promise not to name a single book in this post!
